Everyone from friends in the pub to colleagues in the boardroom talked about cryptocurrency, blockchain, and various dogs going to the moon.</p><p></p><p>Then came the flood of NFTs. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are used to represent digital items such as artwork, music, videos, and other types of digital content. Because each NFT is unique, it can&apos;t be replaced or exchanged for something else, like a traditional digital file can be. This makes them valuable, and they can be bought and sold like other types of assets. When you purchase an NFT, you are buying the rights to that specific digital item and you can prove your ownership via the blockchain.</p><p></p><p>A blockchain is a digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. It&apos;s called a &quot;blockchain&quot; because it is made up of blocks of data that are linked together in a chain. Each block contains a record of multiple transactions, and once a block is added to the chain, it cannot be altered. The biggest advantage of using a blockchain is that it is decentralized, meaning that it is not controlled by a single entity, it is open-source and maintained by a network of computers around the world, this makes it more secure and less susceptible to fraud.</p><p></p><p>While the use and success of NFT are highly debatable, I enjoy looking at the unique and beautiful artwork being created and added to the blockchain every second. This is why I created the NFT viewer displayed at the top of the article.</p><hr><h2 id="how-does-it-work-tech-bit">How does it work (Tech Bit)?</h2><p></p><p><strong>Step 1 - Choosing a blockchain</strong><br>NFTs are built on blockchain technology, a digital ledger that records transactions securely and transparently. There are many different blockchains available, but I choose Solana.</p><p>One of the most significant advantages of Solana for NFTs is its fast transaction speeds. Solana can process up to 65,000 transactions per second, which is much faster than other popular blockchain platforms like Ethereum. This means that buying and selling NFTs on Solana can be done quickly and with minimal delays.</p><p><br><strong>Step 2 - Connecting to the blockchain.</strong></p><p>To connect to the blockchain, I used quickNode. This allows me to query the Solana blockchain without hosting a node myself.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/content/images/2023/01/carbon.png" class="kg-image" alt="NFT Viewer" loading="lazy" width="1534" height="476" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/carbon.png 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2023/01/carbon.png 1000w, /content/images/2023/01/carbon.png 1534w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>Step 3 - Getting the NFT from the blockchain</strong><br></p><p>This part was tricky, and there were a few hoops I had to jump through.

In the last year, it seemed as if any company with the most basic of &#xA0;logic was plastered with one or more of words &apos;AI&apos;, &apos;Artificial intelligence or &apos;real AI.&apos;</p><p>While the true definition of AI is up for debate, companies are developing complex deep learning. One such company OpenAI has developed GPT-3. GPT-3, as described by its authors, is an &apos;autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text&apos;.</p><p>In the last few months, we have seen OpenAI use this model as a basis for many products and showcases. For example, you may be familiar with GitHub co-pilot, a code completion suggestion tool if you are a developer. If you are an artist, you may be familiar with regenerative art or other products such as DAL-E, also created by OpenAI, which generates digital images from natural language descriptions.</p><p>On November 30, 2022, OpenAI released its latest beta, ChatGPT. ChatGPT uses a GPT-3 algorithm to create a chatbot that can hold context between prompts and can be used for many things, such as explaining complex theories, &#xA0;writing articles and writing code. It is the latter example that caused me to ask the question, &quot;will AI replace the need for developers&quot;?</p><p>Instead of creating a post outlining and defending the need for developers in a world of AI, why not get ChatGPT to do it for me? The following are the prompts I used to create the post.</p><hr><h2 id="generating-linkedin-post">Generating LinkedIn Post</h2><p></p><p><strong>Write a thought-provoking article about why we still need developers when we have tools like chatGPT. Make it a size that will fit in a LinkedIn post</strong></p><blockquote>Despite the impressive capabilities of tools like chatGPT, which uses artificial intelligence to generate human-like text, there are several reasons why we will still need developers in the tech industry. <br><br>While chatGPT and similar tools can generate coherent text, they are not capable of creative problem-solving or out-of-the-box thinking in the way that human developers are. They also lack the ability to understand the nuances and complexities of human language and are not able to adapt to new technologies and environments. Additionally, developers bring valuable skills and responsibilities such as testing and debugging software, collaborating with team members, and working with customers and clients, which chatGPT and other AI-powered tools are not capable of. In conclusion, developers will continue to be an essential part of the tech industry, even with the existence of chatGPT and similar technologies.</blockquote><p><strong>Make the main arguments into bullet points.</strong></p><blockquote>Despite the impressive capabilities of tools like chatGPT, they are not capable of creative problem-solving or out-of-the-box thinking in the way that human developers are.<br><br>ChatGPT and similar tools are not able to fully grasp the subtleties of language or the context in which certain words and phrases are used.<br><br>ChatGPT and similar tools are not able to learn and adapt to new programming languages, frameworks, and platforms in the same way that human developers can.<br><br>Developers bring valuable skills and responsibilities such as testing and debugging software, collaborating with team members, and working with customers and clients, which chatGPT and other AI-powered tools are not capable of.</blockquote><p><strong>Add a catchy aggressive one-line introduction.</strong></p><blockquote>ChatGPT may be able to generate human-like text, but it can never replace the creativity, adaptability, and human understanding of a developer.</blockquote><hr><p>Perfect...

In May 2022, I finally arrived back in Las Vegas after two years of separation.</p><p>While I loved visiting, I was shocked by the tactics some hotels used to scrape back the lost wages from the pandemic&#x2014;an increase in resort fees, lack of drink service and higher table minimums.</p><p>The tactic that affected me the most was limiting devices on the hotel Wi-Fi. I found most hotels would only allow you to connect only one or two devices to Wi-Fi within 24 hours. After that, any additional device would cost 35$ a day!</p><h3 id="openwrt">OpenWRT</h3><p>I will be travelling back in the coming weeks, so I spent some time researching a solution and found OpenWRT. Using OpenWRT, I could create a small travel router that would enable me to:</p><ul><li>Connect multiple devices to one connection, removing device limits</li><li>Use a VPN connection to secure all my internet traffic by default</li><li>Set up the connection between all my devices to the router once, speeding up the connection time between hotels.</li></ul><p>I first decided to look into using a USB WIFI adapter with my Macbook to let me connect my laptop to the Wi-Fi and then share the connection through the external USB Wi-Fi. However, I soon found that support for external Wi-Fi adapters was lacking in the new MacBook pros.</p><p>I soon settled on using a raspberry pi, a small credit card-sized computer. Like the Macbook, the Pi has onboard Wi-Fi that I could use to connect to the hotel; I would then use my USB wireless adapter to connect to my other devices.

You are amazed at the products Apple has created, and you reach for your wallet only to find that the site has sold out.</p><p>Several colleagues and I had this problem in the release week of the iPhone 12. Logging in every day to check stock soon became part of our routine. At one point, slack rooms were created to notify people when stock appeared.</p><p>With hours spent refreshing browsers, checking and rechecking, I created &quot;iFound&quot;. &quot;iFound&quot;, a small project that sends a request to the Apple servers to get real-time stock levels of products.</p><h3 id="demo">DEMO</h3><p>The demo below shows how I can check stock without going through the website steps. Entering a part ID and a postcode will check real-time inventory in your local stores.

As a Javascript developer, I explored various options and stumbled upon the captivating world of <a href="https://ghost.org/?ref=localhost">Ghost</a>. </p><blockquote><strong>Ghost is a powerful app for new-media creators to publish, share, and grow a business around their content. It comes with modern tools to build a website, publish content, send newsletters &amp; offer paid subscriptions to members.</strong></blockquote><p>It is a super simple service to get running, with plenty of themes to download. In addition, because it&apos;s written using Javascript and handlebars under the hood, it is easy to extend or modify the functionality.</p><p>Ghost comes out of the box with everything you need to create a blog site, complete with a simple WYSIWYG editor, paywalled articles, and marketing emails. A growing community also builds additional plugins that allow easy integration of analytics, comments, and live chat.</p><h3 id="setup-with-docker">Setup with Docker</h3><p></p><p>Setup with Docker is super simple. A single docker-compose YAML is enough to create both a database and a live running instance of Ghost. You will want to change these configurations for a production deployment, but the following file will allow you to test the CRM in seconds.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src="https://carbon.now.sh/embed?bg=rgba%28171%2C184%2C195%2C0%29&amp;t=material&amp;wt=none&amp;l=yaml&amp;width=680&amp;ds=true&amp;dsyoff=20px&amp;dsblur=68px&amp;wc=true&amp;wa=true&amp;pv=48px&amp;ph=32px&amp;ln=true&amp;fl=1&amp;fm=Hack&amp;fs=13px&amp;lh=133%25&amp;si=false&amp;es=2x&amp;wm=false&amp;code=%2523%2520docker-compose.yaml%250Aversion%253A%2520%273.1%27%250Aservices%253A%250A%2520%2520ghost%253A%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520image%253A%2520ghost%253A5.7.0-alpine%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520restart%253A%2520always%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520ports%253A%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520-%25208080%253A2368%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520environment%253A%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2523%2520see%2520https%253A%252F%252Fghost.org%252Fdocs%252Fconfig%252F%2523configuration-options%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520database__client%253A%2520mysql%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520database__connection__host%253A%2520db%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520database__connection__user%253A%2520ghost%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520database__connection__password%253A%2520example%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520database__connection__database%253A%2520ghost%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520url%253A%2520http%253A%252F%252Flocalhost%253A8080%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520volumes%253A%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520-%2520.%252Fcontent%253A%252Fvar%252Flib%252Fghost%252Fcontent%250A%250A%2520%2520db%253A%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520image%253A%2520mysql%253A8.0%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520restart%253A%2520always%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520environment%253A%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD%253A%2520example%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520MYSQL_DATABASE%253A%2520ghost%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520MYSQL_USER%253A%2520ghost%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520MYSQL_PASSWORD%253A%2520example%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520volumes%253A%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520%2520-%2520.%252Fdb%253A%252Fvar%252Flib%252Fmysql" style="width: 632px; height: 663px; border:0; transform: scale(1); overflow:hidden;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin">

How can we be seen as a serious tech company if we use Wordpress?. I hear this all the time, and i disagree.</p><p>When working at a cutting-edge startup, time is of the essence, making every second count. Hence, allocating the perfect resources for all deliverables becomes paramount. And so, the day arrived when we were handed an exhilarating challenge: crafting a captivating marketing website.</p><p>This website had to possess several remarkable qualities:</p><ul><li>A breeze to host effortlessly.</li><li>Effortless for non-tech-savvy individuals to swiftly manage and update content.</li><li>Seamlessly compatible with off-the-shelf themes that exude excellence.</li></ul><p>As a developer, the possibilities started racing through my mind. I envisioned creating a revolutionary application deployed at the forefront of technology. Imagine, a mind-blowing CMS microservice backed by a NoSQL database. We could harness the power of React, Next, Vue, Ember, SPA, s3, and even unlock the secrets of SEO to dominate the digital realm!</p><p>But then, like a bolt of inspiration, a thrilling realization struck me: why squander our precious resources on an extravagant technological marvel? It was time to shift gears and embrace a more strategic approach. After all, success lies not in the flashy tools we employ, but in the ingenious simplicity with which we conquer challenges.</p><h3 id="wordpress-rules-the-web">Wordpress rules the web</h3><p>Being a good developer means choosing the right tools for the job. We spend a lot of time discussing which tech stack to use, which testing framework fits our workflow, and which modules perform the best.</p><p>So, why is it that when I suggest using a tool like WordPress, the development community rejects and mocks it?</p><p><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/wordpress-stats?ref=localhost">According to W3Techs and hubspot</a>:</p><ul><li>WordPress is used by 43.2% of all websites on the internet.</li><li>With an increased average of 12% per year since 2011, WordPress has been the fastest growing content management system for 12 years in a row.</li><li>Roughly every two minutes, another top 10 million site starts using WordPress.</li></ul><p>We deployed our marketing site using WordPress, which may raise concerns among developers. Will it affect our service&apos;s popularity or imply technical weakness? Not at all! The reality is that using WordPress frees up time and resources to enhance our main SaaS product.</p><p>Oh, and by the way, I chose Ghost for this site because PHP isn&apos;t my cup of tea ;)</p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[About]]></title><description><![CDATA[What is this site all about?]]></description><link>/coming-soon/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">62f180e7b7a8650001a25660</guid><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ashley Buckingham]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2022 21:32:23 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="/content/images/2022/08/altumcode-dMUt0X3f59Q-unsplash-1.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="/content/images/2022/08/altumcode-dMUt0X3f59Q-unsplash-1.jpg" alt="About"><p></p><h3 id="when-i-was-younger-i-was-obsessed-with-magic">When I was younger, I was obsessed with magic.</h3><p>As a child, I was enthralled by magic shows from David Blane, Penn and Teller, and Jay Sankey. I spent hours exploring magic shops in London, searching for the next trick to master and perform for my loved ones.</p><p>The excitement of magic lies in the audience&apos;s reactions, with TV magicians often leaving people jumping, shouting, and running away in disbelief. But I wasn&apos;t interested in performing; I was fascinated by uncovering the secrets behind tricks and reinventing them.</p><p>During a recent conference in Vegas, my colleague/friend surprised me with a deck of cards and asked if I wanted to see some magic. The same excitement rushed through me as I spent the evening in awe, watching him astonish groups of clients at the bar.</p><p>While I don&apos;t see myself becoming a magician, I&apos;ve discovered a similar passion in development. Magic and software development share the thrill of problem-solving, re-engineering solutions, and creating work that leaves the audience awestruck.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/content/images/2022/08/ameer-basheer-4xKm7qT_RMM-unsplash.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="About" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="/content/images/size/w600/2022/08/ameer-basheer-4xKm7qT_RMM-unsplash.jpg 600w, /content/images/size/w1000/2022/08/ameer-basheer-4xKm7qT_RMM-unsplash.jpg 1000w, /content/images/size/w1600/2022/08/ameer-basheer-4xKm7qT_RMM-unsplash.jpg 1600w, /content/images/size/w2400/2022/08/ameer-basheer-4xKm7qT_RMM-unsplash.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="no-portfolio">No Portfolio</h3><p>Create a portfolio!
